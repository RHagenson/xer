# `xer`

`xer` simple utility that Xs out every visual character to force looking at code layout over other elements of code structure. The idea spawned from a talk by Kevlin Henney and reading far too much code with triple-digit line lengths.

Users can also selectively unmask by select Unicode categories or by regex. This functionality is to allow the meta elements to be unmasked (parenthesis, brackets, curly braces, constants, and so on).
